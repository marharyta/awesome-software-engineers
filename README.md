# Awesome Software Engineers

This is a repository that gathers articles and recources about how people became software engineers.

## How to become a programmer? 
A lot of people are asking me this question, and the truth is, there is no easy answer. The hardest part is the beginning of the journey, you probably have no idea what to start with.

> _Just like you would read autobiographies of famous people to learn about life in general, you want to read other programmers' journeys to learn about the path they went through to become coders. You need to read other people's stories._

> _Not only that can inspire you, but also you could try to mimic their journey and learn from the mistakes they made on the way._
